# ai-thing

**ai-thing** is an innovative React utility that generates UI components directly from natural language descriptions. Whether you need to rapidly prototype or want to streamline your development process, **ai-thing** accelerates component creation by interpreting plain English into fully functional React components. 

The library supports multiple UI frameworks, including Material-UI (MUI), Bootstrap, Ant Design, Chakra UI, and Semantic UI, allowing you to configure your project with the framework of your choice.

## Features

- **Natural Language to UI**: Write simple English descriptions, and **ai-thing** will generate corresponding React components with inferred properties.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use popular UI frameworks like MUI, Bootstrap, Ant Design, Chakra UI, and Semantic UI. Simply configure your preferred framework.
- **Customizable**: While the generated components include default properties based on descriptions, you can easily override them for custom behavior.
- **Scalable**: Extendable to support more frameworks and components in the future.
- **NLP-Powered**: **ai-thing** uses natural language processing (NLP) to infer component types and their properties intelligently.

## Installation

Install **ai-thing** via npm:

```bash
npm install ai-thing
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Import and Configure

Start by configuring your preferred UI framework. **ai-thing** supports MUI, Bootstrap, Ant Design, Chakra UI, and Semantic UI. You can switch frameworks at any time.

```js
import aiThing from 'ai-thing';

// Configure the framework (e.g., MUI, Bootstrap, etc.)
aiThing.configureFramework('mui');
```

### Step 2: Generate Components from Descriptions

Use `ai.gen` to describe your components in natural language. **ai-thing** will translate these descriptions into ready-to-use React components.

```js
const Button = await aiThing.gen('A large blue button labeled "Submit"');
const Layout = await aiThing.gen('A grid layout with 3 equally spaced columns.');
const Select = await aiThing.gen('A dropdown menu with options: Podcast, Book, Movie.');
```

### Step 3: Render Your Components

The components returned by `aiThing.gen` are React components that you can directly use in your application. You can also pass additional props when rendering them.

```js
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Select />
      <Button disabled />
    </Layout>
  );
};
```

## Example Usage

```js
import aiThing from 'ai-thing';

aiThing.configureFramework('bootstrap');

const App = async () => {
  const Button = await aiThing.gen('A primary button labeled "Continue"');
  const Input = await aiThing.gen('A text input field with a placeholder "Enter your name"');

  return (
    <div>
      <Input />
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Supported Frameworks

**ai-thing** currently supports the following React UI frameworks:
- **Material UI (MUI)**
- **Bootstrap**
- **Ant Design**
- **Chakra UI**
- **Semantic UI**
- **Shadcn-ui**

Feel free to suggest other frameworks or contribute to expanding the supported frameworks!

## Testing

We use **Jest** for testing. If youâ€™d like to run the tests:

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

This will run the suite of unit tests that ensure the functionality of the NLP parser, component mapper, and overall framework integration.
